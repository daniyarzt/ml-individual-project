
DESCRIPTON
----------

This dataset is composed of 1000 samples with 30 features each. The first column
is the sample id. The second column in the dataset represents the label. There
are 5 possible values for the labels. The remaining columns are numeric
features.

Your task is the following: you should compare the performance of the
k-NearestNeighbors algorithm (implemented by
sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier) with that of a Random Forest
(implemented by sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier). Try to optimize both
algorithms' parameters and determine which one is best for this dataset. At the
end of the analysis, you should have chosen an algorithm and its optimal set of
parameters: write this choice explicitly in the conclusions of your notebook.

Your notebook should detail the procedure you have used to choose the optimal
parameters (graphs are a good idea when possible/sensible).

The notebook will be evaluated not only based on the final results, but also on
the procedure employed, which should balance practical considerations (one may
not be able to exhaustively explore all possible combinations of the parameters)
with the desire for achieving the best possible performance in the least amount
of time.

Bonus points may be assigned for particularly clean/nifty code and/or well-
presented results.

You are also free to attempt other strategies beyond the one in the assignment
(which however is mandatory!).
